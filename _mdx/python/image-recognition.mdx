An image recognition application allows users to classify images into different categories using a machine learning library and a dataset of images. In this project, you will build a simple image recognition application.

<h1>Create a Simple Image Recognition Application</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A way to input an image and receive a classification from the application
  </li>
  <li>A way to train a machine learning model using a dataset of images</li>
  <li>A way to use the trained model to classify new images</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to specify their own categories and
    train the model on a custom dataset?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to upload their own images for
    classification?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
  You can use a machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to
  implement the image classification model for this project. You can also use a
  dataset of images like the{' '}
  <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a> to train the model.
