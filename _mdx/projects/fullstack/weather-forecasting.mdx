Are you interested in building a web application that can display the current and forecast weather for any location? This project is perfect for you! In this project, you will create a full-stack web application for displaying weather forecast using a weather API.

Users will be able to search for the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any location by entering a city or zip code. The application will display the current temperature, humidity, wind, and a brief description of the weather conditions, as well as the forecast for the next five days.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple front-end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li>Integrate a weather API to fetch weather data</li>
<li>Build a server-side application using Node.js and Express</li>
<li>Implement a search feature for users to enter a city or zip code</li>
<li>Display the current weather and 5-day forecast on the front-end</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a feature to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit</li>
<li>Add a feature to save the user's last search</li>
<li>Implement a feature to display weather alerts if any</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

```javascript
// Example code for integrating a weather API using Node.js and Express
app.get('/weather', (req, res) => {
    const {city, zip_code} = req.query;
    axios.get(`https://weather-api.com/weather?q=${city}&zip=${zip_code}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`)
        .then(response => res.json(response.data))
        .catch(err => res.status(400).json(err))
});
```

This code snippet is an example of how to use the GET method to fetch weather data using a city or zip code as a parameter and an API key, and then returning the data in JSON format.
