<li>Design a database to store user information, courses, and student progress</li>
<li>Build an interface for creating and editing lectures, quizzes, and assignments</li>
<li>Implement a feature for sharing courses with others</li>
<li>Allow users to track progress and engagement of students</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement a feature for accepting payments for courses</li>
<li>Add a feature to allow for live classes and discussions</li>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

```javascript
// Example code for creating a new course using Node.js, Express and Mongoose
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
const Course = require('../models/Course')
router.post('/create', (req, res) => {
  const { title, description, modules } = req.body
  const newCourse = new Course({
    title,
    description,
    modules,
  })
  newCourse
    .save()
    .then((course) => res.json(course))
    .catch((err) => res.status(400).json(err))
})
```

This code snippet is an example of how to use the POST method to create a new course using the title, description and modules as parameters, and save it in the database using Mongoose.

As for the frameworks, you can use Node.js and Express for the server-side development, MongoDB for the database, and React.js for the front-end development. Additionally you can use Mongoose for Object Data Modelling, Passport.js for authentication, and Stripe for handling payments.
