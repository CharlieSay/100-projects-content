Are you interested in staying up-to-date with the latest news from a variety of sources? This project is perfect for you! In this project, you will implement a web application for displaying news headlines from different sources using a news API.

Users will be able to view the top headlines from a selection of news sources, filter news by category and search for specific keywords. The application will display the headline, a brief summary, and a link to the full article.

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
```javascript
// Example code for fetching news headlines using Node.js and Express
app.get('/headlines', (req, res) => {
    const {category, keyword} = req.query;
    axios.get(`https://news-api.com/v2/top-headlines?category=${category}&q=${keyword}&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`)
        .then(response => res.json(response.data))
        .catch(err => res.status(400).json(err))
});
```
This code snippet is an example of how to use the GET method to fetch news headlines using category and keyword as parameters, and an API key, and then returning the data in JSON format.
