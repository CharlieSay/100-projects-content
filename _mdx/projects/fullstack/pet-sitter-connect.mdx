Are you a pet owner looking for a pet-sitter or a pet-sitter looking for new clients? This project is perfect for you! In this project, you will create a web-based platform for connecting pet owners and pet-sitters.

Users will be able to create an account, create a profile, and search for pet-sitters by location and availability. Pet-sitters will be able to create a profile, set their availability, and receive requests from pet owners. Both pet owners and pet-sitters will be able to view profiles, read reviews, and message each other to make arrangements.

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

```javascript
// Example code for searching for pet-sitters by location and availability using Node.js and Express
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const {location, availability} = req.query;
    PetSitter.find({location: location, availability: availability})
        .then(petSitters => res.json(petSitters))
        .catch(err => res.status(400).json(err))
});
```

This code snippet is an example of how to use the GET method to search for pet-sitters in the database by location and availability, and then returning the results in JSON format.
