Are you a travel enthusiast looking for an easier way to manage and book your itineraries? Look no further! In this project, you will create a web-based platform for managing and booking travel itineraries.

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

```javascript
// Example code for integrating a travel booking API using Node.js and Express
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const {destination, start_date, end_date} = req.query;
    axios.get(`https://travel-booking-api.com/search?destination=${destination}&start_date=${start_date}&end_date=${end_date}`)
        .then(response => res.json(response.data))
        .catch(err => res.status(400).json(err))
});

app.post('/book', (req, res) => {
    const {user_id, booking_id} = req.body;
    //create new booking in database
    Booking.create({user_id, booking_id})
        .then(booking => res.json(booking))
        .catch(err => res.status(400).json(err))
});

```

This code snippet is an example of how to use the POST method to book a travel option, passing in the user_id and booking_id, and then creating a new booking in the database.
