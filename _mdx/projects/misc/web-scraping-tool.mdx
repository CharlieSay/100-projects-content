In this project, we will be building a web scraping tool using the Rust programming language and a library such as reqwest or surf. The tool will allow users to extract data from websites, and display the extracted data in a user-friendly format.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics of web scraping with Rust and reqwest or surf</li>
<li>Design and implement a user interface for the web scraping tool</li>
<li>Allow users to extract data from websites</li>
<li>Allow users to view the extracted data in a user-friendly format</li>
<li>Test and debug the application</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add support for scraping data from multiple websites at once</li>
<li>Implement a feature for exporting extracted data to a file</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scrapy</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic web scraping function using Rust and reqwest or surf:

```rust
extern crate reqwest;
use select::document::Document;
use select::predicate::Name;

fn main() {
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://www.example.com/").unwrap();
    assert!(resp.status().is_success());

    let document = Document::from_read(resp).unwrap();

    for node in document.find(Name("a")) {
        println!("{}", node.text());
    }
}
```

This code fetches the HTML from a website and uses the select crate to navigate the DOM and find specific elements. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the web scraping tool.
