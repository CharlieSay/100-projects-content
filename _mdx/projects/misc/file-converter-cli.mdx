In this project, we will be building a simple command-line tool for converting between different file formats. The tool will allow users to convert files from one format to another, such as converting a PDF to a JPG, or a WAV to an MP3.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Research different file format conversion libraries</li>
<li>Design and implement a command-line interface for the file conversion tool</li>
<li>Allow users to convert files from one format to another</li>
<li>Test and debug the application</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add support for batch converting multiple files at once</li>
<li>Implement a feature for changing the quality or resolution of the converted files</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
<li>FFmpeg</li>
<li>ImageMagick</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic file conversion function using a library such as FFmpeg:

```rust
extern crate ffmpeg;

fn main() {
    let input_path = "example.mp3";
    let output_path = "example.wav";

    ffmpeg::execute(&["-i", input_path, output_path]).unwrap();
}
```

This code uses the FFmpeg library to convert a file from one format to another, in this case converting an MP3 to a WAV. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the file conversion tool.
