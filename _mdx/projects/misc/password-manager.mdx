In this project, we will be building a password manager using the Rust programming language and the Security-Framework library. The password manager will allow users to securely store and retrieve their passwords, and will include features such as encryption, password generation, and two-factor authentication.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Learn the basics of password security and the Rust programming language</li>
<li>Research and choose the Security-Framework library for building the password manager</li>
<li>Design and implement the password manager using Rust and the chosen library</li>
<li>Test and debug the password manager</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add support for syncing passwords across multiple devices</li>
<li>Implement a feature for exporting and importing password data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
<li>LastPass</li>
<li>1Password</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic password manager using the Security-Framework library:

```rust
extern crate security_framework;

fn main() {
    let password = security_framework::generate_password(/* ... */);
    let encrypted_password = security_framework::encrypt_password(password);
    let decrypted_password = security_framework::decrypt_password(encrypted_password);
    assert_eq!(password, decrypted_password);
}
```

This code uses the Security-Framework library to generate a password, encrypt it, and then decrypt it again. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the password manager using Rust and the Security-Framework library.
