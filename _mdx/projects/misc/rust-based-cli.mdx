In this project, we will be building a command-line application to convert a CSV file to a JSON file using the Rust programming language. This can be useful for working with data in different formats or for integrating with APIs that require JSON input.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Install and set up a Rust development environment</li>
  <li>
    Design and implement a command-line application to read in a CSV file and
    convert it to a JSON file
  </li>
  <li>Test and debug the application using sample data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement additional command-line options or flags to customize the
    conversion process, such as specifying the input and output file paths or
    the JSON formatting
  </li>
  <li>
    Add error handling to the application to gracefully handle invalid input or
    file errors
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the application with a data processing library or crate, such as
    csv or serde
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>csv</li>
  <li>serde</li>
  <li>csv-to-json</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic command-line
application using Rust:

```rust

use std::env;

fn main() {
let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
println!("Hello, {}!", args[1]);
}

```

This code will print the first command-line argument passed to the application. You can then add logic to read in the CSV file and convert it to a JSON file using the provided libraries or crates.
