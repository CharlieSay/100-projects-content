A data analysis and visualization program allows users to analyze and visualize data using Rust and a library like Gnuplot or Plotters. In this project, you will create a basic data analysis and visualization program using Rust.

<h1>Create a Basic Data Analysis and Visualization Program</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A way to import and manipulate data using Rust</li>
  <li>A way to use a library like Gnuplot or Plotters to visualize the data</li>
  <li>
    A way to perform basic data analysis and display the results to the user
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows the user to customize the visualization or
    analysis options?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows the user to export the visualization or
    analysis results to a file or image?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
  For the data analysis and visualization program, you can start by setting up a
  basic Rust program that imports and manipulates data. You can then use a
  library like Gnuplot or Plotters to visualize the data. To perform basic data
  analysis, you can use functions like `mean()`, `median()`, and `variance()`.
  Here is some sample code to get you started with data manipulation in Rust:
</p>

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};
fn main() {
let file = File::open("data.txt").unwrap();
let reader = BufReader::new(file)

let mut data = Vec::new();
for line in reader.lines() {
    let line = line.unwrap();
    let value: f64 = line.parse().unwrap();
    data.push(value);
}

let mean = data.iter().sum::<f64>() / data.len() as f64;
println!("Mean: {}", mean);
```

<p>
  This code opens a file called `data.txt` and reads in the data line by line,
  parsing each line as a floating point number and storing it in a vector. It
  then calculates the mean of the data and prints it to the console. You can
  then build on this foundation by adding the visualization and analysis
  functionality using Gnuplot or Plotters.
