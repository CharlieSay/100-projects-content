In this project, we will be implementing a natural language processing tool for sentiment analysis or topic modeling to analyze and understand text data. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, or news articles.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Choose a language and library for natural language processing (such as
    Python and NLTK, or R and tidytext)
  </li>
  <li>
    Design and implement a system for performing sentiment analysis or topic
    modeling on text data
  </li>
  <li>Test and debug the system using sample data</li>
  <li>
    Integrate the system with a data source or API to perform analysis on live
    data
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improve the performance of the system by experimenting with different
    algorithms or hyperparameter settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a system for visualizing the results of the analysis, such as word
    clouds or topic models
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the system with other natural language processing tools or
    libraries, such as named entity recognition or language translation
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Google Cloud Natural Language API</li>
  <li>AWS Comprehend</li>
  <li>Azure Text Analytics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic sentiment
analysis system using Python and the NLTK library:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess the data
X = ...
y = ...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and fit the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

```
