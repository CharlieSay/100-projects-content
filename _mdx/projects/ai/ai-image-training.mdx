In this project, we will be using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to train a model to recognize and classify different types of images. We will start by gathering a large dataset of images, and then use this dataset to train and fine-tune our model.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Gather a dataset of images for training and testing</li>
  <li>Preprocess and clean the data</li>
  <li>Split the data into training and testing sets</li>
  <li>Train a CNN model on the training data</li>
  <li>Fine-tune the model using transfer learning</li>
  <li>Evaluate the model on the testing data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement data augmentation to improve model performance</li>
  <li>Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters</li>
  <li>Apply the trained model to real-world image classification tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to download and preprocess
the data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Download and extract the data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0
```

<h2>Similar companies / libraries</h2>
There are several companies and libraries that have implemented similar image training
projects, including Google's TensorFlow, Amazon's SageMaker, and Microsoft's Azure
Machine Learning.
