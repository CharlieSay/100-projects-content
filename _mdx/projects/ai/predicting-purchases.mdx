In this project, we will be creating a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on the time of day and their browsing history. This can be useful for businesses to optimize their marketing and sales efforts and better understand customer behavior.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Gather and preprocess data on customer purchases and browsing history</li>
  <li>Train and evaluate a machine learning model using the data</li>
  <li>Implement a system for making predictions using the trained model</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improve the performance of the model by experimenting with different
    algorithms or hyperparameter settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a system for updating the model with new data as it becomes
    available
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the prediction system with a real-time data stream or API to make
    predictions in near real-time
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic machine
learning model using Python and the scikit-learn library:

```python
# Import necessary
libraries from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.model_selection
import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess the data

X = ...
y = ...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and fit the model

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model

accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

```
