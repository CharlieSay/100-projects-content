A recommendation engine suggests products or content to users based on their previous interactions using a machine learning library and a database. In this project, you will create a basic recommendation engine.

<h1>Create a Basic Recommendation Engine</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A way to collect user interaction data (e.g. clicks, purchases, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    A way to use the collected data to train a recommendation model using a
    machine learning library
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to use the trained model to suggest products or content to users
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to provide explicit feedback (e.g.
    thumbs up/down) to improve the recommendations?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to specify preferences or
    constraints (e.g. price range, category) to narrow down the recommendations?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
  You can use a machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to
  implement the recommendation model for this project.
