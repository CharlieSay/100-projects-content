<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to create a basic desktop
application using a framework such as Electron:

```javascript
const electron = require('electron');
const { app, BrowserWindow } = electron;

let mainWindow;

app.on('ready', () => {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
  });
  mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`);
});

```

This code creates a basic desktop application with a main window and loads the main page. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the to-do list management application.
