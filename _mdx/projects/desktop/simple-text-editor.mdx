A text editor is a basic tool that allows users to create and edit text documents. In this project, you will create a simple text editor using Rust and a library like Cursive or Termion for the user interface.

<h1>Create a Simple Text Editor</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A way for users to input and edit text
  </li>
  <li>
    A user interface using a library like Cursive or Termion
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to save and load text documents
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add support for formatting options like bold, italic, and underline?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add support for syntax highlighting for programming languages?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
 To get started with this project, you can begin by setting up a basic user interface using a library like Cursive or Termion. You can then implement the text input and editing functionality, as well as the ability to save and load text documents.

Here is some sample code to get you started with Cursive:

</p>

```rust
extern crate cursive;
extern crate termion;

use cursive::views::TextView;
use cursive::Cursive;
use termion::input::TermRead;
use termion::raw::IntoRawMode;

fn main() {
// Initialize the Cursive root
let mut siv = Cursive::new();

    // Create a new text view and add it to the root
    let mut text_view = TextView::new("");
    siv.add_layer(text_view.layer());

    // Set up the event loop
    siv.add_global_callback('q', |s| s.quit());
    siv.run();

}
```

This code creates a new Cursive root and adds a text view to it. It also sets up an event loop that listens for the 'q' key press and quits the application when it is detected.

You can then build on this foundation by adding functionality to edit the text in the text view, save the edited text to a file, and handle other user actions. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of the text editor using the features provided by the Cursive or Termion library.
