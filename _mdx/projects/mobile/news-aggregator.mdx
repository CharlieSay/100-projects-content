A news app that aggregates and personalizes news articles based on the user's interests and preferences can be a great way to stay informed and stay up to date with the latest news. This app can be a great project for learning about natural language processing, machine learning, and working with news APIs.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate news articles from multiple sources using news APIs</li>
<li>Implement natural language processing to classify and categorize news articles</li>
<li>Use machine learning to personalize the news feed for each user based on their interests and preferences</li>
<li>Design a user-friendly interface to display the personalized news feed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to save articles for later reading</li>
<li>Add a feature for users to share articles with friends and social media</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google News</li>
<li>Flipboard</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

<h2>iOS/Swift</h2>

```Swift

import UIKit
import CoreML

class NewsViewController: UIViewController {

    var articles: [Article] = []
    var interests: [String] = []

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        fetchArticles()
    }

    func fetchArticles() {
        // Code to fetch news articles from multiple sources using news APIs
    }

    func classifyArticles() {
        // Code to classify and categorize news articles using natural language processing
    }

    func personalizeFeed() {
        // Code to use machine learning to personalize the news feed for each user
        // based on their interests and preferences
    }
}

```

<h2>Android Starter</h2>

```java

import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

import java.util.List;

import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModelProvider;

public class NewsActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private List<Article> articles;
    private List<String> interests;
    private NewsViewModel viewModel;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_news);
        viewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewsViewModel.class);

        viewModel.fetchArticles();
        viewModel.classifyArticles();
        viewModel.personalizeFeed();
    }
}

```

The above code snippets are just examples to give you a starting point and are not meant to be fully functional. They will likely require additional code and modifications in order to work as part of a complete news app. For example, you would need to handle the API calls and data storage for the news articles, and design and implement the user interface for the app. Additionally, you would need to implement the natural language processing and machine learning models to classify and personalize the articles. The above code snippets are provided as a guide to help you understand the basic concepts and techniques that would be used to build a news app.
