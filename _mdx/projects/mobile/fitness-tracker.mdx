<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start them</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up the basic structure
of the app:

<h2>Android Starter</h2>

```java

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Set up button click listeners
        Button logWorkoutButton = findViewById(R.id.log_workout_button);
        logWorkoutButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // Open the log workout activity
                Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, LogWorkoutActivity.class);
                startActivity(intent);
            }
        });

        Button viewProgressButton = findViewById(R.id.view_progress_button);
        viewProgressButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // Open the view progress activity
                Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, ViewProgressActivity.class);
                startActivity(intent);
            }
        });
    }

}

```

<h2>Swift/iOS Starter</h2>

```swift

class MainViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Set up button click listeners
        let logWorkoutButton = UIButton(type: .system)
        logWorkoutButton.setTitle("Log Workout", for: .normal)
        logWorkoutButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(logWorkoutButtonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(logWorkoutButton)

        let viewProgressButton = UIButton(type: .system)
        viewProgressButton.setTitle("View Progress", for: .normal)
        viewProgressButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(viewProgressButtonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(viewProgressButton)
    }

    @objc func logWorkoutButtonTapped() {
        // Open the log workout activity
        let logWorkoutVC = LogWorkoutViewController()
        navigationController?.pushViewController(logWorkoutVC, animated: true)
    }

    @objc func viewProgressButtonTapped() {
        // Open the view progress activity
        let viewProgressVC = ViewProgressViewController()
        navigationController?.pushViewController(viewProgressVC, animated: true)
    }
}

```

<h2>Any companies / libraries that have already done this</h2>
There are several popular fitness tracking apps on the market, including Fitbit,
MyFitnessPal, and Strava. These apps offer similar functionality to what we will
be building in this project.
