In this project, we will be building a basic image gallery that allows users to browse a collection of images and view a larger version with a lightbox effect. The gallery will also include navigation buttons for moving between images.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Design and implement an image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
  <li>Create a grid of images that can be clicked to view a larger version</li>
  <li>
    Implement a lightbox effect for displaying the larger version of the image
  </li>
  <li>Add navigation buttons for moving between images in the gallery</li>
  <li>Test and debug the image gallery using sample data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>

  <li>Lightbox</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up the basic HTML structure
for the image gallery:

```html
<div class="image-gallery">
  <div class="image-grid">
    <!-- Add image elements here -->
  </div>
  <div class="lightbox">
    <!-- Add the lightbox content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

This code creates a container for the image gallery and divides it into two sections: a grid of images and a lightbox for displaying the larger version of an image. You can then add the desired images and content to these sections and style them with CSS.
