A virtual reality experience creator allows users to create and share their own virtual reality experiences using 360-degree photos and videos. In this project, you will build a web application that allows users to upload and view 360-degree media, and create immersive virtual reality experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h1>Create a Virtual Reality Experience Creator</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A way for users to upload and view 360-degree photos and videos
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to create immersive virtual reality experiences using HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to share virtual reality experiences with others and view others'
    experiences
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to customize their virtual reality
    experiences with different background music or sound effects?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to create and view virtual reality
    experiences in real-time using a web camera or other input device?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
 To implement the virtual reality functionality, you can use a library like A-Frame or three.js. You will need to create a user interface for uploading and previewing 360-degree photos and videos, as well as a way to share the created experiences with others. You may also want to add features like the ability to add captions or annotations to the experiences, or to allow users to customize the appearance of the virtual reality viewer

Here is an example of ThreeJS code to give you an idea of how to start.

</p>

```javascript
// import three.js library
import * as THREE from 'three'

// create a canvas element to render the scene
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas')
document.body.appendChild(canvas)

// create a WebGLRenderer to render the scene
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas })

// set the size of the renderer to match the canvas
renderer.setSize(canvas.clientWidth, canvas.clientHeight)

// create a scene to hold the VR experience
const scene = new THREE.Scene()

// create a camera to view the scene
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  45,
  canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight,
  0.1,
  1000,
)

// add the camera to the scene
scene.add(camera)

// create a VRControls object to handle VR input
const controls = new THREE.VRControls(camera)

// create a VREffect object to handle VR rendering
const effect = new THREE.VREffect(renderer)

// create a VRDisplay object to handle VR display
const display = new THREE.VRDisplay()

// create a VRManager object to handle VR management
const manager = new THREE.VRManager(renderer, effect, display)

// add objects to the scene

// create a cube
const cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 })
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, cubeMaterial)

// add the cube to the scene
scene.add(cube)

// create a function to render the scene
const render = () => {
  // update the VR controls
  controls.update()

  // update the VR manager
  manager.render(scene, camera)
}

// create a function to animate the scene
const animate = () => {
  // request the next animation frame
  requestAnimationFrame(animate)

  // render the scene
  render()
}

// start animating the scene
animate()
```

<p>
  This code creates a simple VR experience that consists of a green cube that
  the user can view using a VR headset. You can then build on this foundation by
  adding more objects and features to the scene, and using the VRControls,
  VREffect, and VRManager objects to handle VR input, rendering, and display.
