To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>To-Do List</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>To-Do List</h1>
    <form id="add-task-form">
      <input type="text" id="task-input" placeholder="Enter a task..." />
      <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
    </form>
    <ul id="task-list"></ul>
  </body>
  <style>
    /* Add some basic styling for the to-do list */
  </style>
  <script>
    // ToDoList logic in here.
  </script>
</html>
```
