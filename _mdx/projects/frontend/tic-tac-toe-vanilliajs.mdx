<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic Tic Tac
Toe game using JavaScript:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <table id="game-board">
      <tr>
        <td id="cell-0"></td>
        <td id="cell-1"></td>
        <td id="cell-2"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id="cell-3"></td>
        <td id="cell-4"></td>
        <td id="cell-5"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id="cell-6"></td>
        <td id="cell-7"></td>
        <td id="cell-8"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
  <style>
    /* Add some basic styling for the game board */
  </style>
  <script>
    // Create a game state object to track the current player and game board
    const gameState = {
      currentPlayer: 'X',
      board: ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],
    }

    // Add an event listener to each cell to handle clicks
    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('td')
    cells.forEach((cell, index) => {
      cell.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Update the game state and cell text
        gameState.board[index] = gameState.currentPlayer
        cell.textContent = gameState.currentPlayer

        // Toggle the current player
        gameState.currentPlayer = gameState.currentPlayer === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X'
      })
    })
  </script>
</html>
```

This code will create a basic game board with cells that can be clicked to place an X or an O. You can then add additional logic to track the game state and determine a winner.
