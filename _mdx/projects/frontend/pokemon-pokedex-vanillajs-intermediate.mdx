As a Pokémon trainer, it's important to know all about the different species of Pokémon that exist in the world. With a Pokedex, you can easily look up information about any Pokémon you encounter on your journey.

<h1>Create a Pokémon Pokedex</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A list of Pokémon with their names and images</li>
  <li>A way to search for a specific Pokémon by name</li>
  <li>
    A way to view detailed information about a selected Pokémon (e.g. type,
    abilities, moves, etc.)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to filter the Pokémon list by type
    or generation?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to mark their favorite Pokémon and
    view a separate list of favorites?
  </li>
</ul>

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess the data
X = ...
y = ...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and fit the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

```
