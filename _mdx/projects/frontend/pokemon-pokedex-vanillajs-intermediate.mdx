In this project, we will be building a Pokemon Pokedex application using React and Redux, and accessing data from the PokeAPI at https://pokeapi.co/. The application will allow users to browse and search for Pokemon, view their details, and save their favorites.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Design and implement a Pokemon Pokedex application using React, Redux, and
    the PokeAPI
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a system for browsing and searching for Pokemon, viewing their
    details, and saving favorites
  </li>
  <li>Test and debug the application using sample data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement pagination for the Pokemon list</li>
  <li>Allow for custom pagination limits</li>
  <li>
    Add additional customization options, such as changing the appearance or
    adding sound effects
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pokemon API</li>
  <li>Pokeapi.co</li>
  <li>Pokedex</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic React application
with Redux and a Pokeapi client:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import reducer from './reducer'
import PokeapiClient from './PokeapiClient'

// Create the Redux store with the thunk middleware
const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))

// Set up the Pokeapi client
const client = new PokeapiClient()

// Create the root component for the application
function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      {/* Add your application components here */}
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```

This code sets up a basic React application with a Redux store and the thunk middleware for handling async actions. It also includes a Pokeapi client for accessing data from the PokeAPI. You can then add your application components and implement the desired functionality.
