A quiz and game maker application allows users to create and share their own quizzes and games, and compete with others to see who can get the highest score. In this project, you will create a basic quiz and game maker application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

<h1>Create a Quiz and Game Maker</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A way for users to create and customize their own quizzes and games,
    including adding questions and answers, setting time limits, and choosing
    from different game modes
  </li>
  <li>
    A way for users to play and compete against others, with a leaderboard to
    track scores
  </li>
  <li>A user interface for creating, playing, and sharing quizzes and games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to customize the look and feel of
    their quizzes and games, using CSS themes or templates?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to invite their friends or join
    public games with other users?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
  To get started on this project, you can set up a basic web application using a
  framework like React or Angular. You can then implement the quiz and game
  maker functionality using JavaScript, including creating a user interface for
  creating and playing quizzes and games. You can also use a database to store
  quiz and game data, as well as a leaderboard to track scores.
</p>
<p>Here is some sample code to get you started with a React application:</p>

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Quiz and Game Maker</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the quiz and game maker!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

<p>
  This code creates a simple React app with a single component that displays a
  greeting. You can then build on this foundation by adding the quiz and game
  maker functionality and user interface.
