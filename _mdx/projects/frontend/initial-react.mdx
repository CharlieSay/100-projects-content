<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to declare a variable and
assign it a value in JavaScript:


```javascript
let message = 'Hello, world!'; console.log(message);
// Outputs: "Hello, world!"

```


This code declares a variable called message and assigns it the value 'Hello, world!'. The console.log() function is then used to print the value of the message variable to the console. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to explore the basics of JavaScript programming.
