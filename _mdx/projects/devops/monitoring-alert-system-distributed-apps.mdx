In this project, we will be building a monitoring and alerting system to track the health and performance of a distributed application. A distributed application is one that is spread across multiple servers or devices, making it essential to have a system in place to monitor its overall health and detect any issues.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
<li>Install and set up a monitoring tool (such as Prometheus or Datadog) on the servers or devices where the application is running</li>
<li>Configure the monitoring tool to collect metrics and logs from the application and its dependencies</li>
<li>Set up alerting rules to trigger notifications when certain thresholds or events are detected</li>
<li>Integrate the monitoring and alerting system with other tools, such as a ticketing system or chat platform, to facilitate response and resolution of issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement dashboards and visualizations to make it easier to track and analyze the collected metrics and logs</li>
<li>Set up anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns or behavior in the collected data</li>
<li>Integrate the monitoring and alerting system with a distributed tracing tool to help identify the root cause of issues</li>

<li>Implement a notification escalation process to ensure that critical issues are addressed in a timely manner</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prometheus</li>
<li>Datadog</li>
<li>New Relic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic monitoring configuration using Prometheus:

```yml
# Prometheus configuration file

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'myapp'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```
