In this project, we will be implementing a system for automating the provisioning and scaling of infrastructure to improve the efficiency and reliability of deployment. This can include tasks such as provisioning servers, configuring networking and security, and deploying applications and services.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Choose a tool or framework for infrastructure automation (such as Terraform,
    Ansible, or CloudFormation)
  </li>
  <li>
    Design and implement a system for automating the provisioning and scaling of
    infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>Test and debug the system locally or in a staging environment</li>
  <li>
    Integrate the system with a deployment pipeline or continuous delivery
    process
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement a system for managing secrets and sensitive data, such as
    passwords or API keys
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up monitoring and alerting to track the health and performance of the
    provisioned infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a rollback mechanism to quickly revert to a previous version of
    the infrastructure if issues are detected
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Terraform</li>
  <li>Ansible</li>
  <li>CloudFormation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic infrastructure automation configuration using Terraform:

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

output "instance_ip" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
}
```

This code will create an AWS EC2 instance using the specified AMI and instance type. You can then use the output value to retrieve the public IP address of the instance.
