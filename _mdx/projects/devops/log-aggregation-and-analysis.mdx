In this project, we will be implementing a log aggregation and analysis platform using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK). ELK is a popular open-source stack for collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from distributed applications.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Install and set up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on a local or
    cloud-based infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure Logstash to collect and parse logs from the applications and
    servers being monitored
  </li>
  <li>Ingest the logs into Elasticsearch for storage and analysis</li>
  <li>
    Use Kibana to create dashboards and visualizations to make it easier to
    track and analyze the collected logs
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement alerting rules to trigger notifications when certain events or
    patterns are detected in the logs
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the log aggregation platform with a monitoring and alerting system
    for a more comprehensive view of the application's health and performance
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement log retention policies to ensure that important logs are kept for
    a certain period of time, while less important logs are purged
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Elastic</li>
  <li>Splunk</li>
  <li>Sumo Logic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic Logstash
configuration for collecting logs from an Apache webserver:

```conf
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/apache2/*.log"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
  }
  date {
    match => [ "timestamp", "dd/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z" ]
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
  }
}

```
