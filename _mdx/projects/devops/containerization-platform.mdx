In this project, we will be building a containerization platform using Docker and Kubernetes. Containerization allows us to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can be easily deployed and scaled on any infrastructure.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Install and set up Docker and Kubernetes on a local or cloud-based
    infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>Create Docker images for the applications to be deployed</li>
  <li>
    Deploy the Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster using deployment yaml files
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure and manage the deployment and scaling of the applications using
    Kubernetes
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement continuous delivery to automatically deploy new versions of the
    applications
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up monitoring and logging tools to track the health and performance of
    the containers and applications
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate with a cloud provider (such as AWS or GCP) for added scalability
    and management capabilities
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Docker Cloud</li>
  <li>Google Kubernetes Engine</li>
  <li>AWS Elastic Container Service</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to create a basic Docker image
for a Java application: ```

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for a Java application

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine

ADD . /app

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]

```
