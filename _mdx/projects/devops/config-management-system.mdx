<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to create a basic
configuration file using Ansible:

```yml
- name: Configure webserver
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache webserver
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: latest
    - name: Start Apache webserver
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: true
```
