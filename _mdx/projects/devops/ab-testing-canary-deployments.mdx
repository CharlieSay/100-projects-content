In this project, we will be creating a system for A/B testing and canary deployments to improve the reliability and performance of software updates. A/B testing is a technique for comparing two or more versions of a product or feature to determine which performs better, while canary deployments involve rolling out updates to a small portion of users before rolling them out to the entire user base.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Set up a deployment pipeline for the application, including integration with
    a cloud platform or containerization tool
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a mechanism for routing traffic to different versions of the
    application, such as a load balancer or reverse proxy
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the deployment pipeline to automatically roll out updates to a
    small percentage of users as a canary deployment
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement monitoring and alerting to track the performance and stability of
    the canary deployment
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the results of the canary deployment to determine whether to roll out
    the update to the entire user base
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement feature flags to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of specific
    features or updates
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the A/B testing and canary deployment system with analytics tools
    to track user engagement and conversion metrics
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement a rollback mechanism to quickly revert to a previous version of
    the application if issues are detected
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>

To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic canary deployment using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy:

```yml
Resources:
  MyApplication:
    Type: AWS::CodeDeploy::Application
    Properties:
      ComputePlatform: EC2
  MyDeploymentGroup:
    Type: AWS::CodeDeploy::DeploymentGroup
    Properties:
      DeploymentGroupName: MyDeploymentGroup
      ApplicationName: MyApplication
      DeploymentStyle:
        DeploymentOption: CANARY
        DeploymentType: BLUE_GREEN
      LoadBalancerInfo:
        TargetGroupPairInfo:
          ProductionTrafficRoute:
            Type: EXISTING_TARGET_GROUP
          TargetGroup:
            Type: NEW
  MyPipeline:
    Type: AWS::CodePipeline::Pipeline
    Properties:
      ArtifactStore:
        Type: S3
        Location: MyArtifactsBucket
      Stages:
        - Name: Source
          Actions:
            - Name: SourceAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Source
                Owner: AWS
                Version: 1
                Provider: CodeCommit
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: MyApp
              Configuration:
                RepositoryName: MyRepository
                BranchName: master
        - Name: Deploy
          Actions:
            - Name: DeployAction
              ActionType

```
