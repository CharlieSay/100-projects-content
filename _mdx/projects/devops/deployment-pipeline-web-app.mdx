In this project, we will be creating a deployment pipeline for a web application, including integration with a cloud platform such as AWS or GCP. A deployment pipeline is a series of automated steps that ensure the smooth and reliable deployment of an application from development to production.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a version control system (such as Git) for the project</li>
  <li>Create a build script to compile and test the application</li>
  <li>
    Configure a continuous integration server (such as Jenkins) to automatically
    run the build script on every code change
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrate the application with a cloud platform (such as AWS or GCP) for
    deployment and scaling
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up a deployment process to automatically push the application to the
    cloud platform
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement a blue-green or rolling deployment strategy to minimize downtime
    during updates
  </li>
  <li>Add notification alerts for build failures or successful deployments</li>
  <li>
    Implement a staging environment for testing and validation before deploying
    to production
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up monitoring and logging tools to track the health and performance of
    the application in production
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AWS CodePipeline</li>
  <li>GCP Cloud Build</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic deployment
script using the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Deployment script for an AWS EC2 instance
# Build and package the application
mvn package

# Connect to the EC2 instance
ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com

# Stop the application
sudo service myapp stop

# Copy the new version of the application to the EC2 instance
scp -i "key.pem" target/myapp.jar ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user/myapp.jar

# Start the application
sudo service myapp start

```
