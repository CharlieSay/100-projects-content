In this project, you will create a program that performs advanced network analysis tasks using Python. This could include tasks such as analyzing network traffic, detecting network security threats, or analyzing network performance.

<h1>Create a Program for Advanced Network Analysis</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The ability to capture and analyze network traffic using tools like
    Wireshark or Tshark
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to detect and analyze network security threats using techniques
    like packet sniffing and packet analysis
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to analyze network performance using tools like traceroute and
    ping
  </li>
  <li>
    The ability to visualize and interpret network data using libraries like
    Matplotlib or Seaborn
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to customize the analysis tasks and
    parameters?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to save and export the results of
    the analysis?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
  To get started on this project, you may want to familiarize yourself with
  Python libraries and tools like Scapy, Numpy, and Pandas, which can be used
  for network analysis and data manipulation. You may also want to consider
  using a framework like Django or Flask to build a user interface for
  interacting with the program. Here is some sample code to get you started with
  capturing and analyzing network traffic using Scapy:
</p>

```python
from scapy.all import *
def packet_callback(packet):
if packet[TCP].payload:
mail_packet = str(packet[TCP].payload)
if "user" in mail_packet.lower() or "pass" in mail_packet.lower():
print("Server: %s" % packet[IP].dst)
print("%s" % packet[TCP].payload)

sniff(filter="tcp", prn=packet_callback, store=0)

```

<p>
  This code creates a sniffer that captures TCP packets and prints the payload
  if it contains the strings "user" or "pass". You can then build on this
  foundation by adding additional analysis and visualization functionality.
