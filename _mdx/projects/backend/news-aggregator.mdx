A news aggregator application allows users to view and search for news articles from various sources. In this project, you will create a basic news aggregator using Java and a web framework like Spring or JSF. You will also use a database to store news articles and an external news API to retrieve and display them to users.

<h1>Create a Basic News Aggregator</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A way for users to view and search for news articles
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to retrieve news articles from an external news API and store them in a database
  </li>
  <li>
    A way to display news articles to users using a web framework
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to save or bookmark articles for later reference?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add a feature that allows users to filter articles by source or topic?
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
 To get started with this project, you can set up a basic web server using a framework like Spring or JSF. You can then retrieve news articles from an external API using Java's built-in networking libraries. To store and retrieve news articles from a database, you can use a library like JDBC or Hibernate.
Here is some sample code to get you started with a Spring web server:

</p>

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class NewsAggregatorApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(NewsAggregatorApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

<p>
  This code creates a basic Spring app that can be run using the `main` method.
  You can then build on this foundation by adding the news API integration and
  database functionality.
