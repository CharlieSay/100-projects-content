In this project, we will be building a backend API for a blogging platform using Java and MongoDB. The API will allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and comments. It will also include features such as authentication, authorization, and pagination.

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Design and implement a backend API for a blogging platform using Java and
    MongoDB
  </li>
  <li>Include CRUD operations for blog posts and comments</li>
  <li>Implement authentication and authorization for users</li>
  <li>Add pagination for large datasets</li>
  <li>Test and debug the API using sample data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add additional features such as tagging or user profiles</li>
  <li>Implement server-side rendering or caching</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspiration (Any companies/libraries similar)</h2>

  <li>Backend API</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic Java server
and connect to a MongoDB database using Spring Boot:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class BlogApiApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(BlogApiApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

This code uses the Spring Boot framework to set up a basic Java server. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the backend API for your blogging platform. Note that you can also use any other Java framework if you prefer.
