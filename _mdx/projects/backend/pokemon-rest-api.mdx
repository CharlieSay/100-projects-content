In this project, we will be building a REST API for managing a database of Pokémon. The API will allow users to retrieve a list of Pokémon, a single Pokémon by ID, and Pokémon by type. It will also include features such as adding, updating, and deleting Pokémon from the database.

Some of pokemon to use:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Bulbasaur",
    "type": ["Grass", "Poison"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Squirtle",
    "type": ["Water"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Charmander",
    "type": ["Fire"],
    "gen": 1
  }
]
```

<h1>Project Checklist</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Design and implement a REST API for managing a database of Pokémon</li>
  <li>
    Include routes for retrieving a list of Pokémon, a single Pokémon by ID, and
    Pokémon by type
  </li>
  <li>Allow users to add, update, and delete Pokémon from the database</li>
  <li>Test and debug the API using sample data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Project Checklist Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Add authentication and authorization to the API, so that only authorized
    users can make certain types of requests
  </li>
  <li>Add support for pagination and filtering to the list of Pokémon route</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint/Code snippet to start</h2>
To get started, you can use the following code snippet to set up a basic REST API
using a framework such as Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/pokemon', (req, res) => {
  // Return a list of Pokémon from the database
})

app.get('/pokemon/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Return a single Pokémon by ID from the database
})

app.post('/pokemon', (req, res) => {
  // Add a new Pokémon to the database
})

app.put('/pokemon/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Update a Pokémon by ID in the database
})

app.delete('/pokemon/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Delete a Pokémon by ID from the database
})

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API listening on port 3000'))
```

This code sets up a basic REST API with routes for retrieving a list of Pokémon, a single Pokémon by ID, and adding, updating, and deleting Pokémon from the database. You can use this code snippet as a starting point to build the Pokémon REST API.
