We've made them all, on paper and on apps.

Now its time to make your own!

<h1>Create a super simple To-Do List app.</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add custom text to list</li>
  <li>An 'X' button that can complete an item</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add another button per item that allows you to delete, even if not
    done?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you make it store my to-do list so that when I reload the page my list
    persists?
  </li>
</ul>
