Much like PokeAPI, have an endpoint (doesn't matter what framework IF any you use) return a set of pokemon.

bunch of pokemon to use:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Bulbasaur",
    "type": ["Grass", "Poison"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Squirtle",
    "type": ["Water"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Charmander",
    "type": ["Fire"],
    "gen": 1
  }
]
```

<h1>Create a Pokémon REST API</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A database of Pokémon with their names, types, and other relevant attributes
  </li>
  <li>
    Routes for retrieving a list of Pokémon, a single Pokémon by ID, and Pokémon
    by type
  </li>
  <li>A way to add, update, and delete Pokémon from the database</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add authentication and authorization to the API, so that only
    authorized users can make certain types of requests?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add support for pagination and filtering to the list of Pokémon
    route?
  </li>
</ul>
