A distributed version control system (DVCS) allows developers to track and manage changes to code repositories in a decentralized manner. In this project, you will create a DVCS using Java, implementing features like branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

<h1>Create a Distributed Version Control System</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A way for developers to create and manage branches of code</li>
  <li>A way to merge branches of code, including handling conflicts</li>
  <li>A user interface for interacting with the system</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can you add functionality for collaborating with other developers, such as pulling and pushing changes between repositories?</li>
  <li>Can you add support for versioning non-code files, such as documents or media?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
To get started with this project, you can begin by implementing the core version control functionality, including branching and merging. You can use a library like JGit to help with this. Once you have the basic functionality in place, you can then focus on adding the user interface and any additional features.
Here is some sample code to get you started with JGit:

</p>
```java
// Import the JGit library
import org.eclipse.jgit.api.Git;
// Initialize a new Git repository
Git git = Git.init().setDirectory(new File("/path/to/repository")).call();

// Add a file to the repository
git.add().addFilepattern("path/to/file").call();

// Commit the changes to the repository
git.commit().setMessage("Initial commit").call();

```

<p>
This code initializes a new Git repository, adds a file to it, and makes an initial commit. You can then build on this foundation by adding the branching and merging functionality, as well as the user interface.
</p>
```
