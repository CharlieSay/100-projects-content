Much like PokeAPI, have an endpoint (doesn't matter what framework IF any you use) return a set of pokemon.

bunch of pokemon to use:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Bulbasaur",
    "type": ["Grass", "Poison"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Squirtle",
    "type": ["Water"],
    "gen": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Charmander",
    "type": ["Fire"],
    "gen": 1
  }
]
```

<h2>BONUS</h2>
Allow filtering by pokemon type.
