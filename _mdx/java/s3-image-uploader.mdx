An image uploader API allows users to upload and retrieve images from a database using a server-side language and a cloud storage service like AWS S3. In this project, you will create a basic image uploader API using Java and AWS S3.

<h1>Create a Basic Image Uploader API</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A way for users to upload images to the API</li>
  <li>A way to store the uploaded images in AWS S3</li>
  <li>A way to retrieve the uploaded images from the API</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can you add authentication and authorization to the API, so that only
    authorized users can upload and retrieve images?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you add support for resizing and compressing the uploaded images before
    storing them in S3?
  </li>
</ul>
